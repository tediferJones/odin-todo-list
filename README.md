# odin-todo-list

A simple todo list application.  Should be able to create 'tasks' and organize groups of tasks with 'projects'
    - Each task should have a priority, name, dueDate (optional), and a description (optional)
    - Should be able to remove a task once it has been completed
    - Each task should be able to expand to show details, helping keep the UI compact and readable
    - projects should be added to the sidebar as they are created, the sidebar will be used to navigate between projects
    - Should be able to save/load all tasks and projects, otherwise this would not be a very useful application
    - Should be able to remove a project once we are done with it
